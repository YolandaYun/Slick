#
Fixed Thread Pool:
This type of thread pool has a fixed number of worker threads that are created when the pool is initialized.
Each submitted task is assigned to one of the available threads.
If all threads are busy, the task will be queued until a thread becomes available.
*****
import java.util.concurrent.Executors
import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future}

// Create a fixed thread pool with four threads
val executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4)
implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ExecutionContext.fromExecutorService(executor)

// Submit a task for execution
val futureResult: Future[String] = Future {
  // Task logic goes here
  "Task executed successfully"
}

# daemon VS normal thread
even though daemon thread has not end, if normal thread has ended, then execution ends
"if you create a fixed thread pool using Executors.newFixedThreadPool, the threads in that pool are typically non-daemon by default."

A Query can be converted into an Action by calling its result method. The Action can then be executed directly in a streaming or fully materialized way, or composed further with other Actions:

val q = coffees.map(_.price)
val action = q.result
val result: Future[Seq[Double]] = db.run(action)
val sql = action.statements.head
If you only want a single result value, you can call head or headOption on the result Action.
